She smiled and the pavement seemed kinder.
He left a note folded twice and a coffee stain.
They met under umbrellas that didn't match.
A song made them both remember summer rain.
Fingers brushed and the world rearranged itself.
He kept her sweater in the pocket of an old coat.
They named a private little constellation together.
Morning felt generous after that.
