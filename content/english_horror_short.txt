Night's breath pressed against the windows.
Something tapped where silence should be.
A child's lullaby played from an empty room.
Shadows arranged themselves like waiting chairs.
The floorboards remembered every secret step.
A clock counted wrong and time looked back.
He found a photograph with another face in it.
The house exhaled and the lights went out.
