The neon bled into the rain like a confession.
He lit a cigarette and watched the ash decide.
The dame's perfume carried a headline he already knew.
Sirens practiced at the edge of town and never started.
His notebook held fewer truths than his silence did.
Job offers came with fingerprints on the edges.
Moonlight fell through blinds like barred questions.
He folded his coat over the past and paid the tab.
